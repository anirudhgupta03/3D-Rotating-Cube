# 3D Rotating Cube
## Tech Stack: OOPs, Java, Swing
## Aim: Development of 3D computer animations through Matrix Operations

## Abstract
* This project demonstrates how the basic 3D transformations can be programmed in Java to show the movements of a 3D object.
* When the applet starts, a 2D cube appears on the screen. 
* When we press the drag mouse then cube performs rotations in the direction in which the mouse was dragged and thus we can see the 2D rendered image of the cube. 
* Project uses following classes
  * Object3D
  * Display
  * Polygon3D
  * Point Converter
  * Point3D
  * Mouse
  * ClickType
